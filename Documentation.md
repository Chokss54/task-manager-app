# Documentation & Questions

### 1. Describe a situation where you had to debug a challenging issue in a previous project. How did you solve it?
In a previous project, I had to develop a fuzzy search component, but it was particularly challenging because I was new to both React and Typescript. I struggled alot with syntaxes and had difficulty understanding how to to use hooks properly. 

During the project, I had to implement a search feature that could return results even when the user's input didn't exactly match the data (we also call it fuzzy search). With my inexperience, I found myself frequently running into errors and issues. 

I can't recall the specifics on how I solve each issue. But here's a general rule on what I did to minimise inefficiency and to be able to deliver results effectively.
1. Understanding how my code would flow
    - staring at big chunks of code can be devastating but with using more log statements to understand how my code flow and pass data, I was able to figure out most logical issues with my code.
2. Simplifying my algorithms
    - My algorithm would get very complex and prone to error. So I broke it down into simpler steps, making sure that each part works before integrating it together in the component.
3. Having a fresh pair of eyes
    - I have come to realise that peer reviews are very important and most often other people can spot issues that might not be obvious to me.
    - Believe it or not, taking a break and resting is one of the best solution for me when it comes to dealing with syntax errors.
4. Reading documentations
    -  Since Typescript and react was very new to me, I spent alot of time revisiting documentations to makes sure I am writing codes correctly.

### 2. How do your career aspirations align with our company mission?
As a graduate software engineer, my primary goal is to establish a strong foundation in the tech industry by gaining hands-on experience. After discussing with Ofir, I find that my aspiration to grow as a developer aligns well with your company's mission. I value the opportunity to learn and grow over a good financial compensation, understanding that, as a startup, you may not offer the current market salary. However, I am not looking to be underpaid.

Other than that, I can also see big opportunities for learning and growth within your team and am committed to contributing long-term. I am eager to work closely with you and Ofir, to benefit from your mentorship, and to add value to the team.

I am impressed by your company's clear vision and having a strategy for achieving success (based on my discussion with Ofir). Unlike some other startup companies that Iâ€™ve encountered, which lack a clear vision to succeed, your company demonstrates a strong ambition to make a significant impact, which makes me excited about the opportunity to be part of that journey.


### 3. What are some of your strengths and weaknesses as a developer?
Weakness:
- I don't understand things as quickly like some people. I need time to read and review new concepts multiple times to fully grasp and digest. So I think my learning might be slow sometimes.
- My programming skills as a fresh graduate are not very advanced. In university, we covered alot of different languages and frameworks but did not really specialised in one. So I'm like a Jack of all trades, master of none! But in most cases, I still make lots of mistakes as a gradaute developer.

Strengths:
- I'm a very teachable person. I can take criticism and feedback well, using it as an opportunity to improve and learn.
- I am an adaptable person, always willing to try new things with a 'can-do' attitude, and I consistently strive to add value to the team.
